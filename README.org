#+TITLE: jest.el

This package provides helpers to run jest.

This is a fork of [[https://github.com/edmundmiller/emacs-jest][Edmund Miller's jest.el package]], with fixes and updates that allow it to actually work in the repositories I need it in. Because this is a personal fork, I don't really bother writing new tests and fixes are aimed toward Typescript primarily.

* Overview
The main command is jest-popup, which will show a dispatcher menu, making it easy to change various
options and switches, and then run jest using one of the actions.

- jest (run all tests)
- jest-file (current file)
- jest-function (the test function where the pointer is now,
  fallback to current file)
- jest-last-failed (rerun previous failures)
- jest-repeat (repeat last invocation)

A prefix argument causes the generated command line to be offered for editing, and various
customization options influence how some of the commands work. information.
